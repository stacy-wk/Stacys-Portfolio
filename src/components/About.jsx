            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Junior Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
                in Mathematics and Computer Science at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Iâ€™m also 
                expanding my skills into backend development to become a well-rounded full stack developer.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
                I value clean code, thoughtful design, and continuous learning. I'm passionate about tech that is both 
                functional and visually impactful.
